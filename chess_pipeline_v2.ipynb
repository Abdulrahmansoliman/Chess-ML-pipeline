    "# Chess Game Analysis: Building My First ML Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course:** CS156 - Machine Learning Pipeline Assignment 1  \n",
    "**Date:** February 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Chess?\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't want to just do an assignment and get grades. I want to go through my process of learning through something I really love and care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I love chess.** I've been playing it on and off since childhood, and it's one of those things that has stayed with me through different phases of my life. Recently, I've noticed something frustrating: my progress has stalled. I'm not improving like I used to, and my rating seems stuck. That got me thinking—what if I could use machine learning to actually understand my own play and find ways to improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "So for this assignment, I decided to build my first ML pipeline about something that genuinely matters to me: my chess journey. I want a model that can help me improve my performance and increase my ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've collected data from three different accounts across my life:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Era | Platform | Account | Games | Rating |\n",
    "|-----|----------|---------|-------|--------|\n",
    "| Childhood | Chess.com | Abdulrahmansoli | 1,013 | ~700-815 |\n",
    "| High School | Lichess | Abdulrahmansoli | 259 | ~1,300-1,578 |\n",
    "| Present | Chess.com | AbdulrahmanSoliman2 | 169 | ~1,000-1,200 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Models I Want to Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I want to actually improve at chess, I've thought about what models would be most useful. Here's my plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Models (Deep Focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the ones I want to explore thoroughly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outcome Prediction from First X Moves + Context** - Can I predict if I'll win or lose based on how the opening goes and the game context? This could help me understand which openings and early patterns lead to success for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tilt Detection Model** - Do I play worse after losing? Is there a pattern to when I go on tilt? If I can detect this, I can learn when to take breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Engine-Based Early Blunder Model** - Using engine analysis, can I predict when I'm likely to make a blunder early in the game? What conditions lead to my mistakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smaller Analysis Modules (For Later)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are quick but potentially valuable analyses I might explore if I have time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Effect** - Do I perform differently as White vs Black? A controlled expected-score analysis.\n",
    "- **Time-of-Day Effect** - When do I play best? Using cyclic features and confidence bands.\n",
    "- **Opening Recommender** - Which openings should I focus on? (Bucketing openings by type)\n",
    "\n",
    "*I'm honestly not 100% sure about the smaller models yet—I'll see how the main ones go first.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook handles the **data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering** that I'll need for any of these models. The preprocessing is model-agnostic—once I have clean features extracted from my games, I can plug them into whatever model makes sense.\n",

    "I needed to collect all my chess games from different platforms. Here's how I did it:\n",

    "**Chess.com**: I wrote a Python script to download my games automatically using their public API. You can find it here: [`download_chess_pgn.py`](https://github.com/Abdulrahmansoliman/Chess-ML-pipeline/blob/main/download_chess_pgn.py)\n",
    "\n",

    "**About PGN Format**: All chess games are stored in PGN (Portable Game Notation). Each game has:\n",
    "- **Headers**: Player names, ratings, date, time control, result\n",
    "- **Moves**: The actual moves in algebraic notation (e.g., `e4 e5 Nf3 Nc6...`)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why binary first?** In my cleaned dataset (1250 games), draws are rare (44 total). A 3-class model (win/draw/loss) would have very few draw examples in each train/test split, which makes that class unstable. I can still try multiclass later as an extension once the full pipeline is working.\n",
